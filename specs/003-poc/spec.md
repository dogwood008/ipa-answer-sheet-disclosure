## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to select an option from a set of radio buttons on a form. Based on my selection, I want to see a circle drawn within a predefined rectangular area on the PDF.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the form is displayed with a set of radio buttons, **When** I select one of the radio buttons, **Then** a circle is drawn in a specific, predefined rectangle on the output PDF.
2. **Given** a radio button is already selected, **When** I select a different radio button, **Then** the previously drawn circle is replaced by a new circle corresponding to the new selection.
3. **Given** the form is displayed, **When** no radio button is selected, **Then** no circle is drawn in the designated rectangle.

### Edge Cases
- If PDF generation fails after a selection is made, the system MUST notify the user of the failure.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a set of 3 to 5 radio buttons on the input form.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow a user to select only one option from the radio button group at a time.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST, upon a user's selection of a radio button, draw a circle within a predefined rectangular area on the output PDF.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST draw the circle if and only if a specific, designated radio button option is selected by the user. If any other option is selected, or no option is selected, the circle MUST NOT be drawn.
- **FR-005**: The drawn circle's color MUST be black.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST use a compile-time constant to define the x and y coordinates of the rectangle that bounds the circle.
- **FR-007**: If PDF generation fails, the system MUST notify the user.
